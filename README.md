The term "Dutch Pay" is a Korean expression used to describe splitting and settling costs, similar to "going Dutch" in English.
This WebApp will provide convenience in the process of settling up after splitting the bill with your friends and colleagues.

Situations like the following can create complexities when weâ€™re settling up with friends and colleagues.
1) When there is more than one person who paid the bill.
2) When there are multiple bills, but not everyone is included in each bill.

In such cases, this WebApp helps with quick and accurate calculations.
